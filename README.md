# PM Coursework

## Coursework Description
You are requested to form an equity portfolio (where short selling is not allowed) made of the
stocks that appear as the top holdings1
 of an existing open end mutual fund that you will
choose.
Hence you are requested to identify an existing mutual fund (the Selected mutual fund), that
you have to ‘register’ on Blackboard (as you cannot choose the same mutual fund that has
been already selected by other groups) and the mutual fund’s top holdings.
These mutual fund’s top holdings will represent the set of stocks (your Set of investable
stocks) that you will use to form an efficient (à la Markowitz) portfolio (your Group’s
portfolio). The Group’s portfolio (i) belongs to an efficient frontier that you are required to
represent (with a reasonable number of data points) and (ii) is selected according to a criterion
that you are required to specify.
The input for the construction of the efficient frontier is the return information (expected
returns, standard deviations and covariances) about the assets of your Set of investable stocks.
The basis of the return information cannot be but the historical returns of the stocks (which
must be downloaded). However, historical based information can be modified to consider
expectations and/or the impact that special events (like the Covid 19 pandemic impact on
financial markets) could have on historical based information.
At the end of this process, you will have to evaluate the historical performances of two
investments: the Group’s portfolio and the Selected mutual fund.

You are required to use the performance evaluation measures and techniques presented in
class. You are expected to evaluate the two investments against each other, and against two
benchmarks, the MSCI World and the benchmark adopted by the Selected mutual fund.
3
All these steps have to be documented and summarized in a Word document (the Group’s
report).
All the data used in the process and the computations have to be reported in an Excel file (or
in several Excel files.
A summary of the performance evaluation will be presented in the Group’s fact sheet. 

## Coursework Structure
You are required to submit **three (3)** sets of documents: (i) a Group Report (hereinafter: the
Report, of max 3,000 words), (ii) a Group Fact Sheet (hereinafter: the Fact Sheet, of max 2
pages, no word count), and (iii) an electronic folder containing all the Excel files used for the
computation (hereinafter: the Excel Folder). 

**The Report**
The Report is the main output of the project: it must let the reader (and the instructor) understand
and evaluate all the steps and the decisions taken across the entire process. Whenever necessary,
it must refer to the Excel files contained in the Excel Folder. It consists of four sections, each
of them containing a detailed description of each step of the project: 
1. Introduction to the Selected mutual fund
You will very briefly introduce the Selected mutual fund (in particular: its investment
style), the benchmark used to evaluate it, and the source of data.
2. The Portfolio Selection Process
You will:
- present the subset of the mutual fund invested stocks used to form the Group’s portfolio;
- illustrate the adjustments on the return metrics made to run the portfolio selection
analysis;
- show the efficient frontier;
- describe the process for the selection of the Group’s portfolio.
3. The Selected mutual fund and the Group’s portfolio evaluation
You will evaluate the historical performance of both the Selected mutual fund and the
Group’s optimal portfolio using the all the metrics and indicators that you will consider
useful and effective and comment on the results of your evaluation process. You can
compare the Selected mutual fund and the Group’s optimal portfolio against each other and
against (at least) two benchmarks: the official benchmark(s) of the mutual fund and the
MSCI World.
4. The Group’s fact sheet
You will describe and comment on the information presented in the Group’s fact sheet. 

**The Group’s fact sheet**
A fact sheet is a brief document (of two pages max) aimed at helping investors (both existing
and potential) to track the overall performance of an investment fund to take an informed
decision. To this end, the fact sheet is meant to serve as an investor’s guide (see the “Fact Sheet
examples” and “Fund Fact Sheet Guide” documents as a reference).

**The Excel Folder**
You are required to use some information (historical returns on assets, mutual funds, and
benchmarks, and to make a series of computation based on thus information.
The Excel Folder will contain all the information and the computation used in the various steps
of the projects.
You must make sure that the content of the files is readable and clearly understandable (i.e.,
use clear worksheet titles and a brief description, either in the file itself or in the Report). Any
result mentioned in the Report or in the Group’s fact sheet that is not supported by some
evidence in the Excel folder, will not be considered valid.
Computations should not be necessarily done in Excel. You can use any other software tool,
provided that (i) it is mastered by all the group members (as the Group Coursework is supposed
to be the outcome of a collective work); (ii) you got my permission (as I must make sure that
am able to evaluate it). 
The Group’s fact sheet must summarize the information considered useful to evaluate the
historical performance of both the Selected mutual fund and the Group’s portfolio.
